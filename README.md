# mixed-messages

## Description
This is a portfolio project for my Codecademy course.  It will just generate random messages and output them to the console.  There will be three lists of text strings:

- Day of week: Monday - Sunday
- Time of day: morning, at midday, afternoon, night, at midnight
- Things to do: A list of things that could be done, like go grocery shopping, pay bills, etc.

Each time you run the program, it will output the message by randomly picking an item from each list and combining each item to form one sentence saying what you should do and when.  For example:

You should go grocery shopping on Tuesday afternoon.

## How to use
This will just be a single javaScript/NodeJS console app.  You must have NodeJS installed and then you can run it with the following command from the console in the directory where script.js is located:
```
node script.js
```
## Collaborators
I went solo on this one.
